    "An autonomous system is one that operates without _any_ outside intervention-- whether from other machines or humans. There are also _autonomous agents_ that perform specific tasks independently but at the request of an external system. The latter are much simpler to implement. There isn't a clear distinction between the two in general discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical application is a robot, but any type of computer system can be an autonomous system. The _by far_ most common one is a SoC control processor in industrial manufacturing."

    "Above is an example of an autonomous system from a 2024 paper. It's one of many similar models that use _hierachies_, specifically a Goal-oriented planning hierarchy. _Planning_ is a classic problem in machine learning and it hasn't had the same visible success with recent computational advances as computer vision and natural language processing. Active research is ongoing with a new focus on modelling planning problems as language problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current approaches indeed seem to be _generative_ and use LLMs to some degree (private research is infamously tight-lipped). There are no examples of good performance yet. Commercial aircraft have been able to operate autonomously in normal and low-visibility conditions (including take-off and landing) since the 1970s, but modern autonomous systems have yet to demonstrate even that level of reliability (in mass production)."

    "\n",
    "The most advanced examples of autonomous systems to date do not use neural networks, but statistical regression models. They use expert systems (decision-trees) to model _actions_ that are then executed in pre-programmed and very exact sequences, with hand-coded error handling that is typically formally verified using some logical verification tools (or coded in Ada/SPARK). The hardware has typically been hardened RISC architectures running WxWorks (a realtime operating system). WindRiver Linux and FreeRTOS are two other real-time systems that have seen use in terrestrial applications (telecom, IoT) but not in deep space. The top-of-the line models run at about 500 MHz and have the compute performance of a 90s machine. They have practically zero latency and are _extremely_ stable -- they are also built to be programmable virtually down to the transistor-level (ie some parts are FPGAs). That way you can remotely redesign what a part of the hardware does and re-route around parts of the hardware that may be broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a push towards using off-the-shelf components in space and that does work in Low Earth Orbit, but not beyond. Solar interactions can cause enormous voltages and currents in unprotected electronics -- then there's galactic and cosmic radiation that will degrade the actual metal in the etched transistors on the surface of the chips themselves on relatively short timescales. That's not even considering all the particle radiation from the Sun outside the Earth's magnetic field, especially if the space ship is heading for Venus or Mercury.\n",

    "Despite this, all the major space programs have managed to autonomously enter orbit and even land vehicles on remote bodies-- the Moon, Mars, a few asteroids and almost a comet. ESAs Huygens probe descended on Titan in 2005 as part of the NASA/ESA Cassini/Huygens mission-- to date the most distant landing performed. The light-time delay at Saturn is on the order of an hour, so there was no possibility for any outside intervention. "

    "\n",
    "Space environment testing is prohibitively expensive, but with low enough cost to orbit _lossy_ systems are acceptable. Neural models aren't capable of the reliability of traditional systems, so you will lose several during operations. By sending a swarm of systems you can still have a useful quantity left. An advanced enough system could even be self-repairing-- ie, the robots could fix each-other if they break or end up in loops or go wandering off. "

    "A current trend is to build _autonomous agents_ that through repeated prompting with carefully engineered prompts (often pages of preambles) can take actions on its own. For example, Anthropic's Claude Code is essentially a terminal that is implemented as an LLM system. The components typically communicate through MCP (Model Context Protocol) and implement something similar to the diagram at the top of these lecture notes. While certainly a cool experiment, there are fundamental issues with doing that.   Security and safety is only possible to a degree with this kind of system. What's worse is that the security features that do exist in those services are _only relevant to corporate customers_! If you are running Copilot or Claude in your IDE, you have a _massive_ security issue with your computer. Do NOT store any personal economic information such as insurance claims, crypto tokens, bank numbers or credit card information on such a device. Do NOT use such a device for any purchases or secure logins (web or otherwise). In other words, treat it as a _public_ computer.\n",
